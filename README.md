# ChronoSwitch | Unreal Engine 5.7

**ChronoSwitch** is a first-person multiplayer puzzle-platformer. The core mechanic involves navigating two parallel timelines (Past and Future) where the player's actions in one era dictate the state of the other through physics-based causality.

> **Status:** In Development (Academic Project - ITS Video Game Specialist)
> **Role:** Lead Programmer & Game Director
> **Tech Stack:** C++, UE 5.7, Networking (RPCs), Character Movement Component (CMC), Enhanced Input.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### 1. Timeline Switching & Collision Masking
To maximize performance, the world remains static while the **Character** handles the transition logic. 
- **Character-Centric Logic:** Instead of toggling world actors, the Character capsule updates its collision responses to specific Object Channels (`ECC_Past` / `ECC_Future`) in an $O(1)$ operation. This allows for seamless traversal of era-specific obstacles without heavy CPU overhead.
- **Visual State:** A Material Parameter Collection (MPC) is updated via C++ to shift the global color palette (Blue for Past, Orange for Future) and drive environment shaders in real-time.

### 2. Causal Actor System (Async Physics Synchronization)
The `CausalActor` (inheriting from `TimelineBaseActor`) manages objects that exist across both timelines simultaneously.
- **State Management:** Uses an `Enum` to define visibility and collision. In the `Both_Causal` state, the object is physically active in both eras.
- **Async Physics Tick:** To ensure deterministic and stable networked physics using UE5's Chaos engine, the synchronization logic is decoupled from the main game thread. All physics calculations run entirely within the **Async Physics Tick**.
- **Causal Spring Logic:** Custom C++ logic ensures the "Future" mesh actively tracks the authoritative "Past" mesh's transform. Instead of forcing direct transform updates on a standard tick (which causes jitter and breaks collision responses), the system applies calculated corrective impulses and custom "spring" forces directly within the physics thread, maintaining perfect sync even during complex collisions.

### 3. Networking & Movement Correction
The switch mechanic is replicated to handle both player-initiated actions and server-forced events (e.g., global timers).
- **Client-Side Prediction:** The client updates local collisions immediately upon input for zero-latency movement.
- **Network Correction (Rubber-banding Prevention):** When the server confirms a timeline change, `FlushServerMoves()` is utilized to clear the movement buffer. This prevents rubber-banding artifacts caused by outdated collision data in the predicted moves.
- **State Validation:** The system verifies the `PlayerState` to avoid redundant cosmetic triggers if the local prediction already matches the server-authoritative state.

## 💻 Technical Snippets

### 1. Network Correction & Prediction Validation
*This snippet handles server-dictated timeline changes and prevents movement rubber-banding by flushing the CMC buffer.*

```cpp
void AChronoSwitchCharacter::Client_ForcedTimelineChange_Implementation(uint8 NewTimelineID)
{
    // 1. Network Correction: Flush server moves to prevent rubber-banding.
    // Outdated predicted moves rely on old collision data; flushing ensures 
    // the movement buffer is cleared for the new timeline state.
    if (UCharacterMovementComponent* CMC = GetCharacterMovement())
    {
        CMC->FlushServerMoves();
    }

    // 2. Prediction Check: Verify if the local state already matches the server's update.
    if (const AChronoSwitchPlayerState* PS = GetPlayerState<AChronoSwitchPlayerState>())
    {
        // If IDs match, local prediction was successful; skip to avoid double cosmetics.
        if (PS->GetTimelineID() == NewTimelineID) return;
    }

    // 3. Forced Update: Execution for unpredicted changes (e.g., Global Timer events).
    HandleTimelineUpdate(NewTimelineID);
}
```
### 2. O(1) Collision Masking Logic
*Instead of toggling world actors, the character updates its collision response to specific Era Channels, allowing for instant and optimized transitions.*

```cpp
void AChronoSwitchCharacter::HandleTimelineUpdate(uint8 NewTimelineID)
{
    LocalTimelineID = NewTimelineID;

    // Toggle responses: Block current era, Ignore the other.
    ECollisionResponse PastResponse   = (NewTimelineID == 0) ? ECR_Block : ECR_Ignore;
    ECollisionResponse FutureResponse = (NewTimelineID == 1) ? ECR_Block : ECR_Ignore;

    if (UCapsuleComponent* Capsule = GetCapsuleComponent())
    {
        // ECC_PastTimeline and ECC_FutureTimeline are custom Object Channels
        Capsule->SetCollisionResponseToChannel(ECC_PastTimeline, PastResponse);
        Capsule->SetCollisionResponseToChannel(ECC_FutureTimeline, FutureResponse);
    }

    // Trigger visual feedback (MPC) and UI updates
    OnTimelineStateChanged(NewTimelineID);
}
```
