/**
 * A CausalActor is a physics-enabled object that exists in both timelines simultaneously.
 * It implements a "Master-Slave" relationship where the PastMesh (Master) drives the FutureMesh (Slave).
 * 
 * Key Behaviors:
 * - Kinematic Sync: When the PastMesh is held, the FutureMesh follows kinematically to allow lifting other players.
 * - Physics Sync: When released, the FutureMesh uses spring forces to follow the PastMesh, allowing for physical interactions (gravity, collisions).
 * - Ghost Visualization: Displays a visual cue when the two meshes desynchronize due to obstacles.
